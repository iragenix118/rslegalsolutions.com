			<p>The man, who is in a stable condition in hospital, has &#8220;potentially life-changing injuries&#8221; after the overnight attack in Garvagh, County Londonderry. He was shot in the arms and legs.&#8221;What sort of men would think it is accepttable to subject a young girl to this level of brutality and violence?</p>
<p>&#8220;Every child has the right to feel safe and protected in their own home &#8211; how is this poor child going to sleep tonight or in coming nights? What are the long term effects on her going to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite obvious the hypocrites who carried out this dreadful attack don&#8217;t care at all about the children in their community. I wonder how they would feel if their own child witnessed such a level of violence?</p>
<p>&#8220;There is absolutely no justification for an attack like this in our communities and we must all work together to bring those responsible to justice and to stop this from happening to another child.&#8221;</p>
